The Minneapolis College of Art and Design’s Master of Fine Arts program is a community of makers, thinkers, theorists, researchers, and creative professionals working in a mentor- based, interdisciplinary educational environment. This incredible collection of work represents the capstone activity of two years of intensive study and a relentless pursuit of creative excellence. The candidates graduating this spring reflect the truly interdisciplinary nature of our mentor-based program and demonstrate the importance of personal expression and achievement.

The design of this catalog was based around two sidereal years to represent the amount of time these graduates spent in the program. Another major conceptual aspect to this publication had to do with the spiral bind. This binding decision was dictated by my desire for the cycle and that the publication itself was a cyclical object, not linear. Keeping with this conceptual idea, I created the system within the publication to adhere to this cycle. Each spread theoretically represents itself as the cover, by keeping the necessary information visible you will always know what it is you are picking up.

## Logo
Human connections are no longer limited to face-to-face encounters, mouth to ear, or the subtleties of our shifting limbs. The digital world fosters new and different communication as it continues to expand our interactions daily—constant, ever-present, threading itself through the most intimate moments we experience. We use these digital frameworks of interaction for the same purposes as physical interaction, because this realm is real. No longer a secondary virtual existence, the web is now a cultural and existential norm. From this viewpoint I explore the notions of disconnection in relation to ubiquitous digital culture and presence. This work focuses on the conscious decision to disconnect working towards informing a future reconnection with combined cultural and societal existence. Technology’s fluidity, complementary to our existence, facilitates a personal self-awareness—or presence—but disconnecting oneself from these connective tools facilitates the feelings of connection and presence in nature.

The main body of work created parallel with the written thesis publication. This web interaction is my illustration of the Atmospheric Disconnection. Within this interaction I am pushing to create a piece that implements both an appreciation and observance, as well as an active element of participation. The web is activated by one individual whose touch directly effects the film. These interactions are my insights into my interest in our technologies and how they have reached a presence best illustrated as the atmosphere and how we reach moments of un-knowing in such a ubiquitous digital existence.
