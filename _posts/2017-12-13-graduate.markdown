<p class="alcove f4 f3-ns"> Graduate Thesis Publication </p>

The design of this catalog was based around two sidereal years to represent the amount of time these graduates spent in the program. Another major conceptual aspect to this publication had to do with the spiral bind. This binding decision was dictated by my desire for the cycle and that the publication itself was a cyclical object, not linear. Keeping with this conceptual idea, I created the system within the publication to adhere to this cycle. Each spread theoretically represents itself as the cover, by keeping the necessary information visible you will always know what it is you are picking up.
