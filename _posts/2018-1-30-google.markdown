 <p class="alcove f4 f3-ns">Google Brand Studio</p>

While working at Google I worked on numerous projects that ranged from branding, web design, publication design, and video art direction.

This past year I had the opportunity to work on a new initiative for Google's Year in Search. My contribution to this project came in the form of branding the identity of Game of the Year, and working alongside another designer to create the game UI.

The thought for this site was to create something clean, beautiful, and responsive for mobile. The concept focused on mobile because for most, when searching for a restaurant or a coffee shop, their time searching is spent while on the move. So although the desktop site had to be interesting and compelling, I also had to focus on how that would translate and function easily for mobile.
